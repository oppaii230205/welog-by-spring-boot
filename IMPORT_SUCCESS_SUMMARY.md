## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Your Data

Run the queries in `DATA_VERIFICATION_QUERIES.sql` to:

- Check import success
- Explore your new dataset
- Test search functionality
- Analyze content distribution

### 2. Test Your Application

1. Start your backend: `./gradlew bootRun`
2. Start your frontend: `cd blog-frontend && npm run dev`
3. Browse posts to see your imported data
4. Test search with realistic terms like "JavaScript", "React", "AI"
5. Try pagination with your larger dataset

### 3. Practice Database Operations

With 187 real posts, you can now practice:

- Complex queries across multiple tables
- Performance optimization
- Search algorithm improvements
- Data analysis and reporting

### 4. Extend the Scraper (Optional)

The Scrapy project is ready for future use:

```bash
cd dev-to-scraper
scrapy crawl posts -o output.json
```
