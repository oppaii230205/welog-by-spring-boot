-- ðŸ“Š Data Import Verification Queries
-- Run these queries to verify your imported data and explore the results

-- ===== BASIC COUNTS =====
-- Total posts in database
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_posts FROM posts WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Total imported posts (from dev.to authors)
SELECT COUNT(*) as imported_posts FROM posts p
JOIN users u ON p.author_id = u.id 
WHERE u.email LIKE '%@devto.imported.local' AND p.deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Total authors created during import
SELECT COUNT(*) as imported_authors FROM users 
WHERE email LIKE '%@devto.imported.local' AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ===== SAMPLE DATA EXPLORATION =====
-- Show sample imported posts

-- ===== AUTHOR ANALYSIS =====
-- Top authors by post count

-- ===== DATABASE PERFORMANCE =====
-- Check if posts have proper indexes
SELECT
